Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including differeny varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
        <li>1945- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields.</li>
        <li>1953- Cross a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strains that responds well to fertilizers. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
